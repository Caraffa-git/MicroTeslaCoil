## Notes and test results (<a href="https://github.com/Caraffa-git/MicroTeslaCoil/tree/b3fdc67581c9563461222aec662bbb1328c567a8">b3fdc67</a>)
The coil works, but aside from some not-so-wise design decisions that I changed in the current version, I encountered a few problems.
- At first the idea was to use a slayer-exciter sized secondary but as it turned out driving a coil with a frequency close to 5MHz can be challenging. I ended up using a slightly larger secondary with a resonance frequency close to 500-600kHz.
- The lack of TVS diodes cost me some IGBTs so I added them in this version. As it turns out, reverse connection of the primary winding causes high voltage spikes and thus damage to the circuit.
- The inverter I used has a limit of ~60V output, but as it turns out we have some headroom (voltage spikes reach ~120V where IGBTs are rated at 200V) so you can experiment with another inverter. I think the circuit should be able to withstand about 80V on the input.
